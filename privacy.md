## 1. Information We Collect
Sensory Safari does **not** collect, store, or share any personal data unless explicitly stated.  
The app may request limited device permissions (e.g., access to the camera or microphone) **only** when necessary for app functionality. No data is transferred or shared externally.

We may collect non-personal analytics data such as:
- App performance metrics (e.g., crash logs, error reports)

All analytics data, if enabled, is anonymized and cannot identify individual users.

Any information gathered is used solely to:

- Enhance user experience

We do not sell, rent, or trade any data with third parties.

## 3. Third-Party Services
Sensory Safari may use third-party SDKs or APIs to support features like analytics, authentication, or cloud syncing.  
These services are governed by their own privacy policies. Examples include:
- **Google Play Services** (for app updates and crash reporting)
- **Firebase Analytics** (optional anonymous usage analytics)

You can disable analytics tracking in your device settings.

We take reasonable measures to protect user data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.  
However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
